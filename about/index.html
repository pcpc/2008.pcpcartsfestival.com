        <p>
          <strong>Park Cities Presbyterian Church</strong>
          presents its second annual juried exhibition and a sale of fine art,
          <strong>April 5-13, 2008</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the show has a new location! To celebrate their Grand Opening, the Villa Rosa Gables, located in the heart of Uptown at Cole Avenue and Cedar Springs, will host the
          <span class="caps">PCPC</span>
          Arts Festival in their lovely new facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the show dates have been extended! As requested by many of the 2007
          <span class="caps">PCPC</span>
          Arts Festival artists, we will host a three week run of the show, Beginnings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Arts Festival will continue to be displayed in the Villa Rosa Gables for the
          <span class="caps">DADA</span>
          (Dallas Art Dealers Association) annual Spring Gallery Walk reception on
          <strong>April 19</strong>
          and the spring Uptown Dallas Art Walk on
          <strong>April 24</strong>.
          Therefore, the show is likely to be viewed by even more people than the 4,000 who attended last year.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Note: Due to the show extension, the Art Pick-Up date has been moved to Saturday,
