        <p>
          The Art Registration Form must be completed and received by
          <strong>noon, February 14, 2008</strong>
          by e-mail to Lawan Andersen or US mail to 4124 Oak Lawn Ave. Dallas, TX 75219. No incomplete entry form will be accepted. A digital image or two 4×6 photos (if mailed) must be attached to the registration form to be used for identification purposes only. The piece does not have to be finished for the registration form but must be recognizable in the photo. The artist’s statement must also be completed and submitted with the registration form.
        </p>
        <p>Art work will be judged on two criteria this year: artistic merit and appropriateness to theme as also reflected in the artist’s statement. Works must score highly in both categories to win.</p>
        <p>
          Art work will be received on
          <strong>Art Delivery Day, March 8, 2008</strong>.
          If a work is judged to not fit the theme,
          <span class="caps">PCPC</span>
          will eliminate it that day and the artist can take it home. All the accepted work will be judged at a later date. A $25.00 entry fee (cash or check) is required and will be collected on Art Delivery Day. Discretion is expected if nudity is part of your work of art.
        </p>
        <p>Artists must be 16 years of age or older. Due to space limitations, only 1 entry will be allowed per person or group of artists. Artists must reside in the Dallas-Ft. Worth metroplex.</p>
        <p>Acceptable Media categories are original works on canvas, water media on paper, pastels, drawings, fabric, sculpture, and photography. Photography entrants must acknowledge that the work is an original single work created solely by the entrant and that no infringement of copyright exists. The original unmodified camera image must be submitted. A photograph that has elements removed is not eligible. No giclée prints.</p>
        <p>Presentation requirements: Two dimensional works must be appropriately framed (no clip-framed work is acceptable), ready for wall mounting, and must not exceed 42 inches in any direction (including framing). Gallery-wrapped canvas with no exposed staples or tacks will be accepted only if it is properly wired for hanging and all exposed canvas is painted. Sculpture footprint must not exceed 2 feet x 3 feet by 40 inches height. A stand must be provided by the artist and fit within the footprint. The exhibition reserves the right to exclude any entry that presents unusual installation problems, cannot be handled by exhibit volunteers, is improperly framed or is damaged upon receipt.</p>
        <p>
          Artists are to deliver their entry
          <strong>March 8, 2008 between 9:00am and 1:00pm</strong>
          to 4101 Oak Lawn Avenue. Volunteers will be available to help the artists unload their work. No work of art will be accepted after that date and time.
        </p>
        <p>
          All pieces entered are to be available for sale by consignment with the artist receiving 75% and
          <span class="caps">PCPC</span>
          receiving 25% to help defray show costs. Purchased pieces and unsold pieces must be picked up on April 26, 2008 between 10:00 am and 12 Noon at the Gables Villa Rosa, 2650 Cedar Springs, Dallas, 75201. Please make arrangements if you will be unable to pick up your work on that morning and let us know on Art Delivery Day who will be picking it up.
        </p>
        <h3>Awards</h3>
        <p>The top works in each category will be honored with a ribbon. The theme winner in each of the four categories will receive a cash prize of $1,000. The viewers’ choice award will also receive a cash award of $1,000.</p>
